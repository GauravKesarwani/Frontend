It’s Ok to assume that we can write modern ES6 code, but it’s good to ask your peer what they would do for backward compatibility (e.g. transpile)
Help your peer to first establish the API, including addListener (or on), removeListener (or off), once and emit.
Ask them to describe how event listeners work in the browser, and check for a basic understanding of the single event loop
Make sure that your peer takes care of potential memory leaks when implementing once


Event Emitter
There are many great open source implementations of EventEmitters available for reference.

Here is a simple implementation using vanilla javascript with older browser compatibility.

In addition, here are a few chosen examples for reference:

This example, using ES2015 Classes
This example, using lodash and ES6 functions
This example, of Facebook’s event emitter (including type annotations)
This example of a popular, high performance implementation
